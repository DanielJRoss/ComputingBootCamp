## Installation
Python generally comes preinstalled on Ubuntu, but you can check which version you have by typing the following into your terminal:
`python3 --version`

If the above command says you don't have Python installed or if your Python version is not 3.8, you can type the following into your terminal to get the latest version of Python:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.8
```

## Follow-Up Activities

Create a command line utility that filters columns of a CSV file. The utility will take in a CSV file and column indexes that it should select. Use the following usage pattern:

```
usage: csv_parser.py [-h] [-c COLUMN] [-v] csv_file

Process CSV file.

positional arguments:
  csv_file              CSV file to be parsed

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COLUMN, --column COLUMN
                        columns to select from CSV file
  -v, --verbose         print logging messages
```


To build a command line tool, you will need to use [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) or something similar. Your utility should work with any well formatted CSV file, but here is some example data to get you started: [small]({% link media/example_data.csv %}) and [large]({% link media/example_data_big.csv %}).

If you are already familiar with Python, increase the difficulty by allowing a URL to be passed in instead of a file. Your utility will download the CSV file and then parse it. The third-party library [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) will be useful for this.
